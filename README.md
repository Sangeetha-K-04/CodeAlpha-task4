 # 💬 ChatBuddy — A Simple Rule-Based Chatbot in Python

> 🧠 Created as part of my **Python Internship at [CodeAlpha](https://www.codealpha.tech/)**  
> 📌 **Task 4: Basic Chatbot** — A friendly little bot that chats back with rule-based replies.

## 💡 Project Overview

**ChatBuddy** is a fun and beginner-friendly Python chatbot that responds to a few basic messages like "hello", "how are you", "bye", etc.  
It uses predefined rules to understand user input and reply with cheerful, conversational responses.  
This project helped me explore how simple **if-else logic, functions, and dictionaries** can power real interaction.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Rule-based responses using Python dictionary  
✅ Clean and interactive console interface  
✅ Handles unknown inputs gracefully  
✅ Loop-based conversation until user types `exit`  
✅ Beginner-friendly and fully commented
