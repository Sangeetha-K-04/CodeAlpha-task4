 # 💬 ChatBuddy — A Simple Rule-Based Chatbot in Python

> 🧠 Created as part of my **Python Internship at [CodeAlpha](https://www.codealpha.tech/)**  
> 📌 **Task 4: Basic Chatbot** — A friendly little bot that chats back with rule-based replies.

## 💡 Project Overview

**ChatBuddy** is a fun and beginner-friendly Python chatbot that responds to a few basic messages like "hello", "how are you", "bye", etc.
